# Starlight Proxy


This is the **Step 1** to use Starlight:

Set up a Starlight proxy, ideally close to the registry server you are using. 
Configure the proxy server to point to the registry and run it. Starlight supports any standard registry.

## Method 1. Use Docker Compose to deploy Starlight Proxy + Container Registry (Recommended)

This is an all-in-one example in case you don't have full access to a container registry.
We could use Docker Compose to deploy both the proxy and the registry on the same machine.


0. Install [Docker](https://docs.docker.com/engine/install/ubuntu/#install-using-the-repository) and [Docker Compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/install/)  

If using Ubuntu 20.04 LTS, you could install Docker and Docker Compose using the following commands: 
```shell
sudo apt update && \
sudo apt upgrade -y && \
sudo apt install -y docker-compose && \
sudo usermod -aG docker $USER
```
After adding the current user to the `docker` group, you may _need to log out and log in_ to take effect.
To confirm that Docker is working with correct permission, `docker ps` should not print any errors.
```shell
docker ps
# CONTAINER ID   IMAGE     COMMAND   CREATED   STATUS    PORTS     NAMES
```

1. Clone this project and launch the registry and proxy containers from `./demo/compose/registry+proxy`

```shell
git clone https://github.com/mc256/starlight.git && \
cd starlight/demo/compose/registry+proxy && \
docker-compose up -d
# Creating network "registryproxy_default" with the default driver
# Creating starlightproxy    ... done
# Creating starlightregistry ... done
```
The Starlight proxy writes image metadata to `./data_proxy` folder, and
the container registry saves container images to `./data_registry`


2. Verify the registry and proxy are running.
```shell
curl http://localhost:8090/
# Starlight Proxy OK!
curl http://localhost:5000/v2/
# {}
```

The Starlight proxy listens on port 8090. 
We could put a Nginx reverse proxy to handle SSL certificates or load balancing.
But for simplicity, this part is ignored in this example.
Please add port 8090 and 5000 to the firewall whitelist, the worker has to access these ports.

3. Upload a few container images to the registry for testing

```shell
docker pull redis:6.2.1 && \
docker pull redis:6.2.2 && \
docker tag redis:6.2.1 localhost:5000/redis:6.2.1 && \
docker tag redis:6.2.2 localhost:5000/redis:6.2.2 && \
docker push localhost:5000/redis:6.2.1 && \
docker push localhost:5000/redis:6.2.2
```

You could upload other container images to the registry if you like.

🙌 That's it. Please obtain the IP address of the server and proceed to the **Step 2**.

```shell
# update the IP address keep this for future use. 
export STARLIGHT_PROXY=<ip address of your server>:8090
export REGISTRY=<ip address of your server>:5000
```

## Method 2. Use Docker Compose (Starlight Only)

The prebuilt Starlight proxy container image is available at  `ghcr.io/mc256/starlight/proxy:latest`.

0. Install [Docker](https://docs.docker.com/engine/install/ubuntu/#install-using-the-repository) and [Docker Compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/install/)  

If using Ubuntu 20.04 LTS, you could install Docker and Docker Compose using the following commands: 
```shell
sudo apt update && \
sudo apt upgrade -y && \
sudo apt install -y docker-compose && \
sudo usermod -aG docker $USER
```
After adding the current user to the `docker` group, you may need to log out and log in to take effect.
To confirm that Docker is working with correct permission, `docker ps` should not print any errors.
```shell
docker ps
# CONTAINER ID   IMAGE     COMMAND   CREATED   STATUS    PORTS     NAMES
```

1. Clone this project 

```shell
git clone https://github.com/mc256/starlight.git && \
```

2. Set `REGISTRY` environment variable to your own container registry. 

```shell
echo "REGISTRY=http://starlightregistry:5000" >> ./starlight/demo/compose/proxy/.env
```

3. Launch the proxy
```shell
cd ./starlight/demo/compose/proxy && \
docker-compose up -d
# Creating starlightproxy ... done
```

The Starlight proxy writes image metadata to `./data_proxy` folder.

2. Verify the registry and proxy are running.
```shell
curl http://localhost:8090/
# Starlight Proxy OK!
```

The Starlight proxy listens on port 8090. 
We could put a Nginx reverse proxy to handle SSL certificates or load balancing.
But for simplicity, this part is ignored in this example.

🙌 That's it. Please obtain the IP address of the server and proceed to the **Step 2**.

```shell
# update the IP address keep this for future use. 
export STARLIGHT_PROXY=<ip address of your server>:8090
export REGISTRY=<ip address of your server>:5000
```

## Method 3. Build from source

0. Install Go https://go.dev/doc/install ➡️
```shell
wget https://go.dev/dl/go1.17.8.linux-amd64.tar.gz &&
sudo rm -rf /usr/local/go && sudo tar -C /usr/local -xzf go1.17.8.linux-amd64.tar.gz
```

1. Add Go to the environment variable (You may want to change `.zshrc` or `.bashrc` file to permanently add this folder to the `PATH` environment variable)
```
export PATH=$PATH:/usr/local/go/bin
```

2. Verify Go is available with `go version`
```shell
go version
#go version go1.17.8 linux/amd64
```

4. Install necessary tools to build this project

```shell
sudo apt update && \
sudo apt upgrade -y && \
sudo apt install build-essential
```

4. Clone this project.

```shell
git clone https://github.com/mc256/starlight.git && \
cd starlight
```

5. Build Starlight proxy
```shell
make build-starlight-proxy
```

6. Run Starlight
```shell
cd ./out && \
mkdir ./data && \
./starlight-proxy --registry=http://myregistry:5000 &
```

7. Verify the Starlight Proxy is working
```shell
curl http://localhost:8090/
# Starlight Proxy OK!
```

The Starlight proxy listens on port 8090. 
We could put a Nginx reverse proxy to handle SSL certificates or load balancing.
But for simplicity, this part is ignored in this example.

🙌 That's it. Please obtain the IP address of the server and proceed to the **Step 2**.

```shell
# update the IP address keep this for future use. 
export STARLIGHT_PROXY=<ip address of your server>:8090
export REGISTRY=<ip address of your server>:5000
```

## Known Issues

1) Authentication is not supported yet. But will be implemented very soon.
2) We should switch to `nerdctl` ASAP.
